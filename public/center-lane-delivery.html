          <h2>Center Lane Deliveries Block Visibility</h2>
          <div>
            Commercial deliveries happen from the center turn lane. The big truck blocks the line of sight visibility between 
            the pedestrian and the oncoming traffic. The ghost vehicle appears from nowhere
            to simulate the surprise felt by the driver and pedestrian when they spot each other.
