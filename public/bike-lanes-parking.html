          <h2>Parking can be Dangerous with Bike Lanes</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              Drivers finding parking can aggressively enter and exit parking spaces which 
              can be dangerous for bicyclists in the bike lane. Additionally, people exiting parked
              cars can open the doors into the bike lane, which can cause a collision with a bicyclist.
              This is called a "dooring" incident.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bike lanes are great, but complete separation of bicycles and cars is even better.
