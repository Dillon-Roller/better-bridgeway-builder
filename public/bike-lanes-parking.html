          <h2>Parking can be Dangerous with Bike Lanes</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              Drivers finding parking can aggressively enter and exit parking spaces which 
              can be dangerous for bicyclists in the bike lane. <br/><br/>              
              Additionally, people exiting parked
              cars can open the doors into the bike lane, which can cause a collision with a bicyclist.
