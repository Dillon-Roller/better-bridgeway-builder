          <h2>Rapid Flashing Beacons Help Those Who Need It Most</h2>
          <div>
            Bridgeway should be enjoyed by everyone, including those with the most 
            limited mobility. Flashing signs alert drivers to stop at the stop line
            even before observing the pedestrian in the crosswalk. <br><br>
            See <a href="https://nacto.org/publication/urban-bikeway-design-guide/bicycle-signals/active-warning-beacon-for-bike-route-at-unsignalized-intersection/" target="_blank">NACTO Active Warning Beacon</a> to learn more.

            An accessible parking space next to crosswalk provides the most convenient access to 
            both sides of the street.

            Wheelchair players also move slower than the average pedestrian.
