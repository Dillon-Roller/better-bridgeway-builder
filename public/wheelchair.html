          <h2>Wheelchairs Cross the Street Safely with Flashing Signs</h2>
          <div>
            Bridgeway should be enjoyed by everyone, including those with the most 
            limited mobility. Flashing signs alert drivers to stop at the stop line
            even before observing the pedestrian in the crosswalk.
          </div>
          <div>
            Accessible parking space next to crosswalk provides the most convenient access to 
            both sides of the street.
