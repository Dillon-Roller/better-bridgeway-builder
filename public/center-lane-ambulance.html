          <h2>Emergency Vehicles Blocked by Center Lane Deliveries</h2>
          <div>
            Larger vehicles parked in the center lane complicate passage for
            large emergency vehicles like fire trucks and ambulances that must
            use Bridgeway to service the south end of Sausalito.

            When an ambulance periodically appears, all other vehicles pull
            over. The ambulance will pass when a lane has enough clearance, but
            will crash into the obstacle in its path if no clear path can be
            found. <br/> <br/>
            Nobody wins when an ambulance is blocked.
