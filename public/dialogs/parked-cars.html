          <div>
            Now there are parked cars on the road, but crossing too closely to a parked
            car blocks the view between the driver and pedestrian.

            <h3>Watch Out for Ghost Cars</h3>
            <div>
              Ghost cars appear out of nowhere to simulate the surprise a driver and pedestrian feel 
              when seeing each other after their visibility was blocked by a parked car.<br />
              Cross farther away from parked cars to keep the ghosts away.
