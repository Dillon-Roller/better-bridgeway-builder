          <div>
            Now there are parked cars on the road, but crossing too closely to a parked
            car blocks the view between the driver and pedestrian.

              Ghost cars appear out of nowhere to simulate the blocked line of sight.<br />
              Cross farther away from parked cars to keep the ghosts away.
