          <h2>First Responders are Blocked by Deliveries in the Center Lane</h2>
          <div>
            The center turn lane originally was an raised emergency vehicle
            lane. It was converted to a turn lane to allow for more traffic
            flow. Then delivery drivers started using the center lane as a
            loading zone. This blocks emergency vehicles from getting through.
