          <h2>Bicycles and Cars Mixed</h2>
          <div>
            Bicycles are now added to the traffic, but they share the same lane as cars. 
            Cars and bicycles move at different speeds, so the cars will have to slow down
            making for a less efficient and more frustrating experience for drivers.

            <h3>Hint</h3>
            <div>
              Notice the center lane can provide refuge allowing a pedestrian to look a single 
              way for traffic when all cars and bicycles stay in their designated vehicle travel lanes.
