          <h2>Pedestrian Visibility Improved at the Crosswalk</h2>
          <div>
            Open space before a crosswalk removes the parked car blocking the view of the driver to the pedestrian.
            Extending the sidewalk into the parking lane as a "bulb-out" also places the pedestrian in a safe spot
            more in the street confirming vehicles see and stop before crossing. <br/><br/>
            The ghost vehicles are completely gone now.
